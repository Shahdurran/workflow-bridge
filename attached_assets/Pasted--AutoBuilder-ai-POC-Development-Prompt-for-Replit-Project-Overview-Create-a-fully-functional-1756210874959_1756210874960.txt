# AutoBuilder.ai POC Development Prompt for Replit

## Project Overview
Create a fully functional Proof of Concept (POC) for AutoBuilder.ai - an AI-powered workflow automation builder and migration tool. This should be a single-page React application that demonstrates the core value proposition through an interactive demo.

## Core Features to Implement

### 1. Conversational Workflow Builder
**Chat Interface:**
- Clean chat UI with message bubbles (user messages on right, AI on left)
- Typing indicator animation when AI is "thinking"
- Quick action buttons for common requests ("Build automation", "Migrate workflow", "Browse templates")
- Chat history with ability to scroll through conversation
- Input field with send button and Enter key support

**AI Conversation Flow:**
- Welcome message explaining the tool's capabilities
- Step-by-step questioning to understand user needs:
  - "What trigger do you want to use?" (email received, form submitted, etc.)
  - "Which apps do you want to connect?" (with popular options)
  - "What actions should happen?" (send email, create record, etc.)
  - "Which platform do you prefer?" (Zapier, Make, n8n)
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- Ability to modify previous choices
- Confirmation before generating workflow

### 2. Visual Workflow Representation
**Interactive Flowchart:**
- Node-based visual editor showing workflow steps
- Different node types:
  - **Trigger nodes** (green): Email received, webhook, schedule
  - **Action nodes** (blue): Send email, create record, API call
  - **Logic nodes** (purple): Conditional, delay, filter
  - **Platform nodes** (orange): Zapier, Make, n8n indicators
- Connecting lines between nodes showing data flow
- Hover effects showing node details
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Real-time updates as user describes workflow in chat

**Node Design:**
- Icon + app logo for each integration
- Node labels with clear action descriptions
- Status indicators (configured, needs setup, error)
- Connection points for linking nodes
- Expandable details panel on click

### 3. Platform Selection & Export
**Platform Switcher:**
- Tabbed interface or dropdown for Zapier, Make, n8n
- Platform-specific branding and colors:
  - **Zapier**: Orange (#FF4A00) theme
  - **Make**: Purple (#6366F1) theme  
  - **n8n**: Pink (#EA4B71) theme
- Real-time workflow conversion when switching platforms
- Platform-specific node styling and terminology
- Export buttons for each platform's JSON format

**Export Features:**
- "Export to Zapier" button generating Zapier-compatible JSON
- "Export to Make" button generating Make scenario JSON
- "Export to n8n" button generating n8n workflow JSON
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Download as file option
- Preview modal showing the JSON structure

### 4. Migration Demonstration
**Migration Tool:**
- "Import Existing Workflow" section
- File upload area for JSON files from different platforms
- Platform detection (auto-identify source platform)
- Migration preview showing before/after comparison
- Side-by-side workflow visualization
- "Convert to [Target Platform]" buttons
- Migration report showing:
  - Successfully converted elements
  - Elements requiring manual setup
  - Compatibility warnings

### 5. Template Library
**Pre-built Templates:**
- Grid layout of popular workflow templates
- Categories: Marketing, Sales, Productivity, E-commerce
- Template cards showing:
  - Workflow name and description
  - Apps involved (with logos)
  - Complexity level (Beginner/Advanced)
  - Platform compatibility badges
- Search and filter functionality
- "Use Template" button to load into builder

**Sample Templates:**
- "Lead Magnet to Email Sequence" (Form → Email → CRM)
- "Customer Support Ticket Router" (Email → Slack → Helpdesk)
- "Social Media Cross-posting" (Blog → Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook)
- "E-commerce Order Processing" (Store → Inventory → Shipping)

## Design System & Styling

### Color Scheme
**Primary Colors:**
- Primary Blue: #2563EB (for primary actions, links)
- Success Green: #10B981 (for completed states, success messages)
- Warning Orange: #F59E0B (for warnings, pending states)
- Error Red: #EF4444 (for errors, critical actions)
- Neutral Gray: #6B7280 (for text, secondary elements)

**Background Colors:**
- Main Background: #F8FAFC (light gray)
- Card Background: #FFFFFF (pure white)
- Chat Background: #F1F5F9 (slightly darker gray)
- Code Background: #1E293B (dark for JSON preview)

### Typography
- **Headings**: Inter or Poppins (bold, modern)
- **Body Text**: Inter or system fonts (readable, clean)
- **Code/JSON**: Monaco, 'Courier New' (monospace)
- **Chat Messages**: Inter (conversational feel)

2. **Welcome** → AI greets user and offers to build automation or migrate existing
3. **Discovery** → AI asks clarifying questions about user's needs
4. **Building** → Workflow appears visually as user describes requirements
5. **Platform Selection** → User can switch between Zapier/Make/n8n views
6. **Export** → User gets working JSON file for their chosen platform
7. **Migration Demo** → User can upload sample workflow to see migration in action

### Secondary Features
